This is the tool to generate the project upgrading package.

1. Compile the tool
   gcc crc32.c package.c -o package

2. Copy tool to bsp/images

3. Create package
   ./package [pkg_desc] [pkg_name] [images ...]

You can choose to either generate a full package that includes each
binary or a package just for that part that has been changed.

Example:
<1> To create a upk by including everything
   ./package "package by yada_yada on 2010-06-27" upgrade.pkg
u-boot.bin env.img uImage.img root.yaffs

<2> To create a upk by just including the rootfs
   ./package "package by blah_blah on 2010-06-27" upgrade.pkg root.yaffs
